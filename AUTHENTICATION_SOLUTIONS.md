# 🔐 Power BI Authentication Solutions

## ❌ The Problem: AADSTS65002 Error

You encountered this error:
```
AADSTS65002: Consent between first party application '871c010f-5e61-4fb1-83ac-98610a7e9110' 
and first party resource '00000009-0000-0000-c000-000000000000' must be configured via 
preauthorization - applications owned and operated by Microsoft must get approval from 
the API owner before requesting tokens for that API.
```

This happens because the Power BI CLI client ID requires admin consent that most users don't have.

## ✅ Solution Options (No Authentication Required)

### 🎯 Option 1: Power BI Template File (Recommended)

**Zero authentication needed - works offline!**

```bash
# Create a Power BI template file
python3 scripts/powerbi_template_creator.py
```

**What you get:**
- `BevcoTemplate.pbit` file with complete data model
- Pre-built relationships and DAX measures
- Sample visualizations ready to use
- Just double-click to open in Power BI Desktop

**How to use:**
1. Run the script above
2. Double-click `BevcoTemplate.pbit`
3. Point to your CSV files when prompted
4. Publish to Power BI Service

### 🌐 Option 2: Web Browser Automation

**Uses browser automation to bypass API issues**

```bash
# Install Selenium and run web automation
python3 scripts/powerbi_web_automation.py
```

**What it does:**
- Opens Power BI Service in browser
- Guides you through manual login
- Automates workspace creation
- Uploads files automatically
- Opens report editor for you

### 📊 Option 3: Manual Upload with Guided Process

**Simplest approach - no automation needed**

```bash
# Generate data only
python3 generate_data_standalone.py

# Follow the online guide
# See ONLINE_POWERBI_SETUP.md
```

**Steps:**
1. Generate sample data (36,400 transactions)
2. Go to app.powerbi.com manually
3. Create workspace
4. Upload CSV files one by one
5. Build dashboard using our guides
